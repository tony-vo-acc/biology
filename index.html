              Fungi are important decomposers and symbiotic partners in nature, recycling nutrients and supporting
              plants.
              Some fungi are also parasites and pathogens that affect crops, animals, and humans.

              Taxonomy changes over time as scientists learn more using DNA evidence. Some groups (like

          Cryptomycota, also known as the <i>hidden fungi</i> due to their tiny size (3–5 μm), are a recently discovered
          group of microscopic fungi that often live inside other organisms as parasites. Unlike most fungi,
          Cryptomycota
          lack chitin cell walls during part of their life cycle and usually do not form large mycelia.

              Cryptomycota are commonly found in aquatic and moist environments. In these ecosystems, they act as
              parasites
              of other fungi and protists. By infecting organisms, Cryptomycota help regulate microbial populations and
              contribute to balance within aquatic biomes.
            </p>

            <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
              Because Cryptomycota were only discovered recently, much of their life cycle is still being studied.
              Scientists
              know they reproduce through spores and likely use both asexual and sexual reproduction, although sexual
              stages
              have not yet been fully confirmed. As parasites, their spores infect host cells and develop inside them.
            </p>

            <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
              Due to this limited understanding, there are currently no clear human applications for Cryptomycota, and
              most
              research focuses on learning more about their biology and evolution.

        <p class="page-intro">
          Microsporidia are a group of extremely small, single-celled parasites that infect a wide range of animals,
          including insects, fish, and humans. Because they live and reproduce inside host cells, they have very simple
          structures compared to most fungi. Despite their small size, Microsporidia can have significant effects on the
          health of their hosts.

            <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
              Microsporidia produce very resistant spores that contain a specialized structure called a <b>polar
                tube</b>,
              which is used to inject their contents into host cells. They mainly reproduce asexually inside host cells,
              producing large numbers of spores that spread to new hosts. There is evidence that some species may also
              have
              sexual stages, although this is still being researched.
            </p>

            <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
              Microsporidia infect a wide range of animals, which helps regulate population sizes in natural ecosystems.
              By acting as parasites, they can influence insect and other small animal populations and affect food webs.
            </p>

            <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
              Microsporidia are studied in medicine because some species can infect humans, especially people with
              weakened
              immune systems. Research focuses on understanding these infections and developing better treatments rather
              than traditional antibiotics, since Microsporidia are not bacteria.

          Chytridiomycota are mostly aquatic fungi that live in water and moist environments. They are usually
          unicellular
          or form simple, thread-like hyphae. Chytrids are unique among fungi because they produce motile, flagellated
          spores

              Chytridiomycota reproduce asexually by releasing swimming zoospores that move through water to find new
              hosts
              or substrates. Many species also reproduce sexually, involving the fusion of cells followed by nuclear
              fusion,
              which leads to genetically diverse offspring.
            </p>

            <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
              In aquatic ecosystems, chytrids act as decomposers by breaking down dead organic material and recycling
              nutrients back into the environment. Some species are parasites of algae, protists, and animals, which can
              influence population sizes and community structure in aquatic environments.
            </p>

            <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
              Chytridiomycota are important in research on aquatic ecosystems, disease ecology, and environmental
              monitoring.
              Studies of chytrid fungi have helped scientists better understand emerging wildlife diseases and ecosystem
              health.

            </p>

            <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
              They can reproduce by forming spores, and some lineages have sexual stages that produce durable resting

              Their exact life cycles vary widely depending on whether they are parasites, predators, or decomposers.

              Ecologically, they help control populations of insects and other small organisms and are part of soil and

              Basidiomycota usually have septate hyphae and often form visible fruiting bodies (mushrooms). Their sexual
              spores
              are produced on club-shaped structures called basidia.
            </p>

            <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
              Sexual reproduction is a key part of their life cycle, and many have long-lived stages where compatible
              hyphae
              share a cell without immediately fusing nuclei. They also reproduce asexually in some cases, depending on
              species.

            <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
              Ecologically, Basidiomycota are major decomposers of wood and leaf litter and are important partners in
              mycorrhizae
              with plants. They also include plant pathogens (rusts and smuts) that can impact crops.

          “Deuteromycetes” (sometimes called fungi imperfecti) is a historical group used for fungi where no sexual
          stage was
          observed. Many of these fungi were later reclassified into Ascomycota or Basidiomycota once their sexual
          stages
          were discovered.

              Structurally, many “deuteromycetes” look like typical molds with septate hyphae and asexual spores
              (conidia).
              The label is based on reproduction observations, not true evolutionary relationships.
            </p>

            <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
              They reproduce asexually, often by producing conidia. Over time, many were reassigned to modern groups
              once DNA
              evidence and sexual stages were identified.
            </p>

            <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
              This category is still useful in education and applied fields because many medically or agriculturally
              important
              fungi are commonly identified by their asexual forms.
